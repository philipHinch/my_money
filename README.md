# myMoney - Expenses Tracking App 

(Work in progress...)

This is a personal **React** Project focused on user authentication and database read/write/update.

Asyncronus programming. State management with usereducer, use context and usestate. 

I have decided midway to modify the profile page and split it into components. Also i added the user info to context for better access.

I have put a lot of learning effort and did a lot of reaserch and studying during the development of this project and I have understood certain concepts now. I learnt more about firebase authentication, database, storage. Also how important are async functions and to sync the states.

Currently I am pushing commits to the backup repository.

Had some confusion with git branches, commits are messy
