# myMoney - Expenses Tracking App 

(Work in progress...)

This is a personal **React** Project focused on user authentication and database read/write/update.

Asyncronus programming. State management with usereducer, use context and usestate. 

I have decided mid-development to improve the app (since I was having issues with state sync accross different components and the profile page being too bloated) and modify the profile page by splitting it into components. Also i added the user info and isAuthRead to context for easier access. I also created login, signup and logout custom hooks to furter improve the code and make the navbar leaner.

This project made me sweat. I have put a lot of learning effort and did a lot of reaserch + studying during the development of this project and I have now a better understanding of certain concepts that were unclear. I learnt more about firebase authentication, database, storage. Also how important are async functions and to sync the states.

Had some confusion with git branches, commits are messy
